So this did seem to be the solution (in my note above).

If using my example from above, you want this to look like:

 stream {
     server {
         listen 11016 udp;
         proxy_pass juniper_close_stream_backend;
         proxy_responses 0;
     }
 }
This tells nginx not to expect a response, which it shouldn't need from UDP. I don't know why their examples don't show this when discussing DNS, which can be entirely UDP driven.
